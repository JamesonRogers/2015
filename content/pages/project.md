### Project Proposal

Your proposal should be about 1-2 pages. Your can submit an Ipython notebook or a pdf. Please zip or tar your submission, the same way you do for the HW. The file title should be TFINITIALS_FIRSTNAMETM1_LASTNAMETM1_INITALSTM2_INITALSTM3_INITALSTM4.zip

So if your project team has members from the TFs, and Verena is the TF for your project, your filename could be: VK_Xufei_Wang_YC_PO_RM.zip

The one full name is just so we can uniquely identify your project team. There is no significance to which member you choose. 

There is a dropbox called _Project proposal_ where you can submit your proposal. 

The deadline for the proposals is April 10th.


When you write a proposal it is good to answer the following questions:

- What is the problem you are addressing?
- What has been done already?
- What are the questions you are trying to answer?
- What methodology are you planning to use?
- What data do you have available?

### Poster

The poster does not have to describe your final results, but you should be fairly close. You can generate figures from your Ipython notebook for the poster by saving the output from the notebook.
During the fair you can get valuable feedback not only from your TF, but also from the other TFs, Pavlos and Verena.
Extension school students who cannot present at the fair will have the opportunity to submit their posters ad pdfs and get some feedback this way. 


### Final Report

Your final report should be about 6 pages. The style should be similar to a paper. You should have an Abstract, Introduction, Related Work / Libraries used, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion.

We also need access to your code / data. If the data is large, please provide links for the TFs so they can download all necessary material.


### Screencast

This is really your chance to show off what cool stuff you did. Please don't make this boring. Do not just scroll through your notebook and read your comments. You can easily save figures from your notebook as .png files and make a short presentation. We didn't have cool show off videos this year, and would very much like to change this. So provide cool summaries of your projects to the next generation of AM207!


### Webpage

The webpage is optional, but if you do one, you can have the webpage graded instead of your worst HW grade. It is also a really nice way to make your work accessible to the world. If you do a webpage, please be sure to include the link in your final report.
