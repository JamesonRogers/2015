Title: Policies
Author: Verena Kaynig-Fittkau

## General Policy

All materials, lecture notes, lab notebooks, and examples will be put on the course homepage. Homework deadlines and project report/poster dates will also be put on this website.

Lectures are being videotaped, however it is strongly recommended that you attend all the lectures, as they will be fun. Lecture notes and lab notebooks will be posted online, but there might or might not be materiral talked about in class that are not reflected in the notes posted online. Finally the course is heavily based on examples, and we will demonstrate a lot of the methods with these examples during class.

Attending the labs will be helpful both in furthering your understanding and in doing your homework.





## Course Grade

Your course grade is calculated as:

* 55% Homework
* 5% Participation
* 40% Final Project

Participation includes discussions during lectures and labs (for non-extension school students) as well as discussions on Piazza.

## Grading

Teaching Fellows will evaluate your work holistically, focussing on the overall quality of the work using the following scale:

5 Points: Exceptional / above and beyond
4 Points: Solid / no mistakes (or really minor)
3 Points: Good / some mistakes
2 Points: Fair / some major conceptual errors
1 Point : Poor / did not finish?
0 Points: Did not participate / did not hand in

What we are looking for is your understanding of the problem. This means that it is very important for you to communicate your understanding. Undocumented code often does not very well communicate this. Think of your homework as a report to a knowledgable peer. Explain your approach and the solution, and your expectations and surprises along the way. 

## Originality and Plagiarization
You must do your own work, we have zero-tolerance for plagiarization.

You must acknowledge any soure-code that was not written by you by mentioning the original author(s) directly in your source code (comment or header). Whole classes or libraries should be acknowledged with a comment at the `import` statement. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. However, if these rules are followed it is totally fine to use libraries and even encouraged.

You may use examples you find on the web as a starting point, provided its license allows you to re-use it. You must quote the source using proper citations (author, year, title, time accessed, URL) both in the source code and in any publicly visible material.

If you have any doubts about whether a library is ok to use in your work, please direct your question to one of the TFs.

## Homework Policy

** There will be 10 problem sets during the semester. Problem sets are handed out weekly (on Thursday, after class) and are due the following Wednesday, at 11.59PM, unless otherwise announced. **

The goal of the assignments is to develop your computational skills while learning the essential stochastic methods.

You will be handing in homework as IPython notebooks. Your IPython notebook should be saved with all the cells executed, however it also needs to be runnable from beginning to end.

You must provide explanations for all answers that you wrote. Writing code is not enough. Imagine you are explaining the subject to a knowledgable peer: thats how your homework should read. And, please, *comment* your code.

You should hand in one solution per person, but you are encouraged to work in groups of three or less fo rthe homework and final project. Collaboration means you work together; it does not mean you split the work. Each student is expeted to work on all homeworks and questions. **All code should be your own**. An ISite with a dropbox will be provided for your homework and project submissions. The dropbox for each homework and project will close on the deadline for that piece of work. **Do not submit in the last minutes before the dropbox closes.** ISites is known to not be fully in synch with the clock you are watching, or you might encounter connection problems, etc. 

Each student is given ** four late days ** for homework at the beginning of the semester. A late day extends the individual homework deadline by 24 hours without penalty. **No more than one late day may be used on any one assignment. Assignments handed in more than 24 hours after the original deadline will not be graded.** If you have already used all your late days for the semester, we will deduct 2 points for assignments <24 hours late. We do not accept homework more than 24 hours after the original deadline. Late days are intended to give you flexibility: you can use them for any reason no questions asked. You don't get any bonus poitns for not using your late days. Also, you can only use late days for the individual homework deadlines. All other deadlines (e.g. project deadlines) are hard. 

We understand however, that medical factors may occasionally interfere with your ability to participate or to hand in work on time. If that factor is an extenuating circumstance, we will ask you to provide documentations.

If you believe there is an error in your assignemnt grading, please submit an explanation via email to us within 3 days of receiving the grade. No regrade requests will be accepted orally, and no regrade requests will be accepted more than 3 days after you received the grade for assignment.


## Project Policy

In addition to the homework there will be a final project. The final project schedule is on the projects link of the website. You will be expected to produce a written paper (no longer than 6 pages), a screencast, and a poster to showcase your project. You can write the paper in the ipython notebook if you prefer.

All code and data (of reasonable size) used for the project must also be submitted. This may be in Ipython notebooks, or separate files. If your data set is large, tell us where to find it. If it is proprietary, talk to us ahead of time.

If you wish to use a language other than Python, talk to the TFs first.

**BONUS** You are also encouraged to make a web site for your project. If you do this we will drop your worst homework in calculating your homework grade, and grade your web site instead. This does not mean you can skip doing a homework: you have to do them all. But, this does mean that you do get a chance to improve your grade!

The dropbox for the project will close on the deadline for that piece of work. NO work will be accepted after the deadline. **Do not submit in the last minutes before the dropbox closes.** 
## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with the instructor by the end of the second week of the term to identify, discuss, and document any feasible instrucitonal modifications or accommodations. Students from the extension school should contact the (extensions school disability office)[http://www.extension.harvard.edu/resources/disability-services]. Failure to do so may result in inability to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although the instructor might contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementations.
