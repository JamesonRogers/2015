      "It is rumored that buried under the piled up snows brought to us by the Blizzardpocolypse of 2015 theres is a modest road known as the Boulevard of Broken Dreams (*Green Day*).  Along this road you'll find scattered the shattered hearts of humorists who are \"the giggle at a funeral\" (*Hozier*) and also of one Richard Sherman (*Seattle Seahawks*). Let's assume the broken hearts are distributed according to the function $\\heartsuit(\\theta) \\sim \\frac{ {\\rm sin^{34}}\\theta}{\\theta^2}$ from $0< \\theta< \\infty$ and $\\heartsuit(\\theta )=0$ otherwise.  As a current humorist, it is your job to try to integrate $\\heartsuit(\\theta)$.\n",

      "(b) Use importance sampling to evaluate the same integral.  Use the pdf of $\\mathcal{N}(20,0.5)$ for your importance sampling distribution.  Why is this not a good choice? Try to choose a good importance sampling distribution and evaluate again.  Do you see a reduction in variance?  For both importance sampling distributions, run 100 simulations of 100,000 points. \n",
