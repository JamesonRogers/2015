You have named these extraterrestrial nucleotides 'F', 'R', 'L', 'A', and 'E'. NASA has given you a DNA sample consisting of $p=20$ sequences of DNA, each of them with a lenght $l=100$ nucleotide bases that you can find in <a href=\"Sequences.dat\">this file</a>. Each row of the table is a DNA string. You are asked to find a particular substring (we call it a motif) of $k = 6$ consecutive nucleotides that appears to repeat itself very often in the DNA you were given, but that appears only once in each of the sequences. You quickly realize that the problem is equivalent to maximizing the joint probability distribution $p(x_1,x_2,...,x_p)$ in a p-dimensional space that the most \"mutually similar\" motif (in this case an identical sequence of $k$ elements) starts at positions $\\left\\{x_1,x_2,...,x_p\\right\\}$ of your set of $p$ sequences. \n",
